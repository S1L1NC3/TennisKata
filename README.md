<h2>Summary</h2>
Hello :)

This is a simple application, but of course I won't just say "Run" to compile :D  I want to explain my code first of all. I created simple much as I can and don't wanted to input fields from user or whom is
inspecting the code. ViewBinding used for accessing to ui components. Player data classes & models created for OOP standards. Tried to escape from boilerplate code much as I can and used Scope Functions
fore better and less BoilerPlate code. And very simple code for code review and refactor. If you see better code or can give suggestions, I would love to hear.
